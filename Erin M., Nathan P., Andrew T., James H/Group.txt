No member of our group is taking Engi1040 yet,
 so we had zero starting knowledge with circuits,
let alone knowledge of how to use KiCad.
It may have taken the whole week and a lot of googling and videos,
but together we think we have figured out how the program functions 
and almost understand how to make a proper circuit.
